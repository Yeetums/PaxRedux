PB_ENG_WUP_Victory:0 "A Workers Union Victory"
PB_ENG_WUP_Victory_desc:0 "For the first time in British and Imperial history the Workers Union Party (known as the WUP) has won the General election. The party of the working class has captured the heart of Empire. However old party grievances  are already coming to light between the pragmatic Clement Attlee and the utopian Phillip Snowden. Not just the leadership of the WUP, but the path of all of Britannia is at stake."
PB_ENG_WUP_PM_Snowden:0 "Prime Minister Wells"
PB_ENG_WUP_PM_Snowden_desc:0 "Even if it is diffucult, we must not sacrifice our ideals and principles. The people have elected us for one purpose; to improve thier conditions and improve the state of Britain as a whole with the bright light of socialism. To sacrifice that goal for any reason whatsoever would be a gross betrayal of the citizenry of these fair isles. Wells will lead britain to a new age."
PB_ENG_WUP_PM_Atlee:0 "Prime Minister Attlee"
PB_ENG_WUP_PM_Atlee_desc:0 "The WUP has just won it's first election in history, and if we are not careful we will never win another. We are in an incredibly precarious position; the king himself, the aristocracy, corporate executives, and even a decent chunk of the populace is against us. If we don't play this extremely carefully and cause the establishment to act against us, we risk losing this opportunity at improving Britain. Attlee is the only man who can walk the tightrope."
PB_ENG_WUP_Whig_concessions:0 "Offer Concessions to the Whigs"
PB_ENG_WUP_Whig_concessions_desc:0 "By no means did we win this election by a landslide. If we wish to reliably pass any legislation, we will need non-WUP MPs on our side. The Whig party widely supports industrial reformism, meaning reproachment and cooperation with them can be a powerful tool in fixing Britain's broken industrial system."
PB_ENG_WUP_Experiment_Communes:0 "Expiriment With Communes"
PB_ENG_WUP_Experiment_Communes_desc:0 "Robert Owen, the founder of our philosophy, took a particular interest in communes. The idea is to build small, self sufficient communes that are firmly held together by their communities."
PB_ENG_WUP_new_tranquility:0 "New Tranquility Project"
PB_ENG_WUP_new_tranquility_desc:0 "Inspiried by the New Harmony town that Owen founded, New Tranquility will be a small town of 3000 people located in the scottish lowlands, built on 1000 acres of land. All residents will live in one residential building, with each family getting their own apartment. There will be a large public kitchen and dining hall, along with communal recreation areas. The settlement will include aquaponics facilities, along with several factories. The town will be designed to be entirely self sufficient."
PB_ENG_WUP_rural_boundaries:0 "Draw Communal Boundaries in Rural Areas"
PB_ENG_WUP_rural_boundaries_desc:0 "While attempting to create communal organization in the more Urban/Suburban parts of Britain would be met with fierce resistance, and would upend already very entrenched systems, creating them in rural or even unincorporated areas would be more possible. Many of these areas have little to no organized local governance, and could be relatively easily organized into a communal system."
PB_ENG_WUP_new_view:0 "Begin Implementing the New View"
PB_ENG_WUP_new_view_desc:0 "''...the present arrangement of society is the most anti-social, impolitic, and irrational that can be devised; that under its influence all the superior and valuable qualities of the human race are repressed from infancy, and that the most unnatural means are used to bring out the most injurious propensities...'' -Robert Owen"
PB_ENG_WUP_owen_realized:0 "Owen's Dream Realized"
PB_ENG_WUP_owen_realized_desc:0 "New Serenity has been a complete success. Robert Owen's dream, 80 years after his death, has been realized. New communal pojects modeled after the Serenity expiriement are being set up in several areas throughout the country, and plans to attempt to expand the idea to other parts of the empire are in the works."
PB_ENG_WUP_partyopposition:0 "Deal With the Party Opposition"
PB_ENG_WUP_partyopposition_desc:0 "The self proclaimed 'Pragmatists' within our party are becoming a very large problem. Beliving that 'too radical' reform will upset the balance, they oppose many of our proposals and are seriously slowing us down."
PB_ENG_WUP_left_reaction:0 "Dealing with the left-reactionaries"
PB_ENG_WUP_left_reaction_desc:0 "Even our party is not free of reactionism. Many in our movement subscribe to deeply regressive social views and they are a stain on the WUP. They have to be driven out."
PB_ENG_WUP_Cooperatives:0 "Transition to Cooperativism"
PB_ENG_WUP_Cooperatives_desc:0 "Most services in this country are not operated by the people who work for or utilize them, nut by corporate executives with no motive besides profit. This needs to be fixed. We will begin to transition select companies and government services into a cooperative system, where they are run by both the worker and the consumers."
PB_ENG_WUP_rapid_education:0 "Rapid Education Development"
PB_ENG_WUP_rapid_education_desc:0 "Robert Owen firmly belived in education, and so do we. The education system in Britain is severely outdated and in dire need of improvement."
PB_ENG_WUP_augmentmed:0 "Encourage Bio-Mechanical Development"
PB_ENG_WUP_augmentmed_desc:0 "Despite being one of the most revolutionary developments in the last century, bio-augmentation and genetic therapy is still largely niche and not very widely used. By providing funding for both research and application of bioscience, we improve the technology and provide it for more people in need of it."
PB_ENG_WUP_encourage_development:0 "Encourage Technological Development"
PB_ENG_WUP_encourage_development_desc:0 "While certainly coming with many problems, the technological development of the last two centuries have provided far better standards of living for the people of the Empire. By encouraging further development, we can ensure the standards of living continue to improve."
PB_ENG_WUP_utopia:0 "Utopia Tommorow!"
PB_ENG_WUP_utopia_desc:0 "The task will be long and difficult, but even so we are marching on towards our ideal socialist utopia!. The future is bright and happy comrades, and few will be able to stop us."
PB_ENG_WUP_12_workday:0 "Mandate 12 Hour Max Workday"
PB_ENG_WUP_12_workday_desc:0 "As of now, the workers of Britain are forced to toil for as long as fourteen hours daily. Workers go home exhausted from work, with little time to relax or pursue personal hobbies. This needs to be changed. We will mandate that the limit of the workday be twelve hours."
PB_ENG_WUP_Nationalize_industry:0 "Nationalize Key Industries"
PB_ENG_WUP_Nationalize_industry_desc:0 "Britain's industry is almost entirely in private hands. This makes it so the industrial sector is complettely out of the control of the government or the people. In order to ensure that the poeple have more control over the industries they work in, and ensure these industries work entirely for public interests, we will nationalize Britain's key industries."
PB_ENG_WUP_National_Industrial_Plan:0 "National Industrial Plan"
PB_ENG_WUP_National_Industrial_Plan_desc:0 "Following the collapse of the British economy, the British industry began to severely fall behind and became woefully inneficient. The National Industrial Plan is designed to guide Britain's industry into new growth, and to heal the damage that the economic collapse brought."
PB_ENG_WUP_working_woman:0 "Empower the Working Woman"
PB_ENG_WUP_working_woman_desc:0 "Despite working just as hard as her male counterparts, despite the fact that she is just as important to the functioning of this great nation as any man, the working woman of britain is repressed and harmed by our society. It is well past time that the working woman gets the life she so deserves."
PB_ENG_WUP_Directcontrol:0 "Directly Control Nationalized Industry"
PB_ENG_WUP_Directcontrol_desc:0 "While it would be wonderful to transition our country to a totally cooperative economy, the resistance we would encounter trying, and the sheer resources it would require are too much to be feasable as od now. Instead, we will put our nationalized industry under direct control of parliment, to ensure it operates in the best interests od the people."
PB_ENG_WUP_extendingwelfare:0 "Extend Welfare Programs"
PB_ENG_WUP_extendingwelfare_desc:0 "The extension of Britain's welfare system is perhaps the best change we can make to help the working class of Britain without large structual changes."
PB_ENG_WUP_tradfarming:0 "Support Traditional Farming"
PB_ENG_WUP_tradfarming_desc:0 "With the advent of large scale Aquaponic farming, traditional field farming has begun to fall out of favor. This is a great problem for many, as many farmers in Britain rely on their traditional farms in order to make a living and survive. To alleviate this, we shall begin to support and favor traditional farmers so that they may continue to survive."
PB_ENG_WUP_holdauto:0 "Slow Automazation"
PB_ENG_WUP_holdauto_desc:0 "Automazation is a large problem for many workers in Britain. Many are finding themselves out of work, having been replaced by more efficient machines that don't have to worry about good conditions and can work around the clock. To help alleiviate the job loss, we shall begin to put taxes on automation, along with other incentives to keep companies using human labor."
PB_ENG_WUP_one_step:0 "One Step at A Time"
PB_ENG_WUP_one_step_desc:0 "While the process may be slow and painful, we are gradually reforming Britain for the better. It will not be easy, but perhaps we may transform these fair isles into a haven for the people after all."
PB_ENG_WUP_alliance_of_convinience:0 "An Alliance of Convinience"
PB_ENG_WUP_alliance_of_convinience_desc:0 "While their ideals may differ from ours, we must not alienate the more nationalist cliques within the party. We are on very thin ice, and their moderately large support base is indispensable to us."
PB_ENG_WUP_placating_mosely:0 "Placating Mosely"
PB_ENG_WUP_placating_mosely_desc:0 "Oswald Mosely, out of all of the more nationalist elements in our party, is certainly the most infuential, and SURELY the most rowdy. In order to keep him from going rouge and screwing up our opportunity, we will placate him by giving him a cozy position in the government where he can live out his power fantasies without bothering the general public"
PB_ENG_WUP_nationalist_prop:0 "Issue Nationalist Propaganda"
PB_ENG_WUP_nationalist_prop_desc:0 "Many of our opponents portray us as Britain hating monsters hellbent on destroying Britsih culture. In order to both soothe these fears, and to garner support among nationalists, we will begin to put out very nationalistic propaganda with a pro WUP spin."
PB_ENG_WUP_winning_small:0 "Win Over Small Buisnesses"
PB_ENG_WUP_winning_small_desc:0 "Instead of attacking all private enterprise in general, we see it more pragmatic to go against simply large corporations, and attempt to garner some support from small buisnesses that have been trodded on by the uber-wealthy."
PB_ENG_WUP_comfort_them:0 "Comfort Them"
PB_ENG_WUP_comfort_them_desc:0 "Many conservatives seem to belive we are Satan incarnate and that we are completely hellbent on ending the concept of Britain. In order to soothe these unfounded fears, we will assure the public that our reforms are restrained, light, and in the best interest of the people."
PB_ENG_WUP_Union_support:0 "Garner Support From Unions"
PB_ENG_WUP_Union_support_desc:0 "The unions in Britain already hold immense sway. Organized strikes have completely paralyzed the country in the past. Considering they already support the WUP, not capitalizing on this valuable tool would be foolish."
NH_bejeweled_roadblock:0 "The Bejeweled Roadblock"
NH_bejeweled_roadblock_desc:0 "King Edward is an authoritarian and an anti-socialist, and he has made this abundantly clear. When the WUP originally won the election, he reportedly attempted to bar us from forming a government before his advisors talked him down. Along with that, he has had countless little 'slip-ups' in which he has hinted at his authoritarian and near ultra-nationalist views. If we want to guarantee our socialist future, we must get rid of the King."
NH_going_digging:0 "Going Digging"
NH_going_digging_desc:0 "The best course of action is to simply go digging and make light of a scandal to have the king abdicate. Doing anything harsher could not only be traced back to us, killing the dream, but a violent method would be a betrayal of our values."
NH_kill_bastard:0 "Just Kill the Bastard!"
NH_kill_bastard_desc:0 "Edward simply has to be killed, he is far too much of a threat. Anything less than killing him would either risk not getting rid of him, or even him catching wind and taking action against us. It is time for King Edward VIII to die."
NH_hatch_plot:0 "Hatch A Plot"
NH_hatch_plot_desc:0 "This is an extremely delicate affair, and thus we need to hatch a clear and consise plan to ensure this doesnt get royally screwed up."
NH_spread_scandal:0 "Spread The Scandal"
NH_spread_scandal_desc:0 "As it turns out, the King's so called 'gesture of goodwill' trips to the United Commonwealth were really made so he could sneak off and have an affair with American actress Wallis Simpson. The fact he is having an affair with an American actress, and that his trips to America were all booty calls is going to make for a huge scandal. This needs to be spread."
NH_blame_it:0 "Blame It On The NPP"
NH_blame_it_desc:0 "If the assasination is ever tied back to us, it's over. By blaming it on the NPP, we can both ensure that its not tied back to us and destroy the NPP's national standing, knocking out two birds with one stone."
NH_next_steps:0 "The Next Steps"

NH_socialist_future_desc:0 "Socialism and Britain are now synonomous. We have fully ensured that the future of these fair isles shall be bright red. Yet, not all of the work is done and we still have a long way to go. Now it falls to us to deciding how this red future will look."
NH_fight_menace:0 "Fighting the French Menace"

NH_continued_coop:0 "Further Cement Cooperativism"
NH_continued_coop_desc:0 "Cooperativism has been an incredible success. People feel as if they actually have a say in the services they consume and create. Workers are beaming as they have complete say in how they work instead of being fully subservient to their bosses. Considering this huge success, we would be fools not to expand this further!"
NH_expand_commune:0 "Expand the Commune System"
NH_expand_commune_desc:0 "The commune system has been incredibly popular among our population. The people within these communities have said they feel more connected to their neighbors than they ever could have imagined. This connection has made people happier, and in turn this happiness has made every facet of British society run smoother. We must spread this new way of living to all who are open to it!"
NH_question_future:0 "Questioning the Future of the WUP"
NH_question_future_desc:0 "The future of the WUP, and Britain as a whole is up for debate. As many in the WUP evolve their socialist ideals, the idea of a unified WUP is becoming more and more redundant. Perhaps we should plan for the end of the WUP to make sure it goes smoothly, instead of it blowing up and hurting us all."
NH_supercharge_development:0 "Supercharge Development"
NH_supercharge_development_desc:0 "Contrary to what the Pragmatist fools claimed, the new technology we have developed have drastically improved British life.

NH_monarchy_referendum:0 "Referendum on the Monarchy"
NH_monarchy_referendum_desc:0 "As the war went on, George VI became more and more of a recluse, to the point that he was not seen for weeks at a time. This has shown the people of Britain how pointless the monarchy truly is. It is time to be done with this antiquated institution."

NH.britain.1:0 "Choosing a Prime Minister"
NH.britain.1.a:0 "Prime Minister Attlee!"
NH.britain.1.b:0 "Prime Minister Wells!"
NH.britain.1.d:0 "Now that the WUP party has actually won an election, we now need to make the important descision of deciding our prime minister. Two candidates have been put forward, each from one of the two factions of our party. \n\nThe first candidate and the presumed choice, Clement Attlee, hails from the Pragmatist faction of the party. He is considered the safer choice, as he belives that socialist reform needs to be very slow and restrained to be succesful. However, being a pragmatist, Attlee is not above making rather bloody actions if it will ensure our future.\n\nThe second option, H.G Wells, follows the Utopian faction of the WUP. Wells is a very well known writer, and is an immensely popular figure among the left. Wells belives that the priority must be rapid improvement of the people's conditions, pragmatism be damned. Being a utopian however, Wells is largely uncomfortable with violent or damaging actions for the sake of socialism, and prefers to make changes by reforming the system."
NH.britain.2:0 "Prime Minister Wells"
NH.britain.2.a:0 "'Congratulations, Prime Minister Wells'"
NH.britain.2.d:0 "H.G Wells was sittling quietly in his office, calmly writing a story in his journal. He had already accepted that the WUP would choose Attlee over him, after all why wouldn't they?\nAttlee was the safe choice, and would walk on eggshells to not upset anybody. Wells was, however popular for his writings, seen as someone not very in-tune with reality. Wells was always caught up in looking to the future after all, seldom considering the state of the present. Many saw his utopian dreams as idealistic and impossible. They saw his methods of radical change through drastic reforms as laughable and non-sensical.\n\nThe silence in the room was suddenly broken by a rather short woman bursting through the door. Margaret Bondfeild, the candidate set to become the Minister of Labor, stopped herself in front of Wells' desk and slapped her hands down on it's surface. Her face was red and she was panting, she had evidently ran here\n'Mister Wells' the woman foced out. 'The WUP has selected you as prime minister'\nWells sat shocked, hardly able to belive her. They had chosen him over Atlee? Millions of thoughts raced through Wells head as he realized he finally had the chance to march Britain towards his ideal Utopia."
NH.britain.3:0 "Prime Minister Attlee"
NH.britain.3.a:0 "'Good luck, Clement.'"
NH.britain.3.d:0 "Clement Attlee sat anxiously at his desk, tappin his pencil. He already knew that he would realistically be the choice for the new prime minister, now he just waited for the work to begin. Soon, he knew, he would be entrusted with perhaps the most important job in the country; that being, walking the tightrope to the lofty goal of socialism. He just hoped he wouldn't fall.\n\nRamsay MacDonald, his ideological brother and good friend, cracked open the door, smiling. Attlee shot up as if he has been put on the earth for this moment.\n'You got the job, Clem'\n Attlee's face quickly turned into a beaming smile. It was time for the first step to be taken."
NH.britain.4:0 "Meeting with nationalists in the WUP"
NH.britain.4.d:0 "Despite how much Prime Minister Clement Attlee may despise the nationalists within the WUP, they sadly have a decent amount of support. With the Utopians refusing to talk to them whatsoever, the Nationalists have been largely ignored with many of them defecting to the NPP. Their large support base despite being sidelined makes the Nationalists a perfect candidate for getting the Pragmatists more support.\n\nClement Attlee knocked on a door on a moderately sized home in north London, where  the Nationalists were having a meeting.\n'Ah, Clement! Come in, come in.' said Oswald Mosely, the leader of the remaining nationalists within the WUP. As Attlee walked into the living room of the house he was struck by a strong odor of liquor. Looking around the room, Attlee began to feel deeply uncomfotable as he recognized the faces of several notoriously abhorrent men who had said things so regressive it would put the Marshal of France to shame. Knowing what was at stake however, Clement clenched his teeth and forced a smile.\n'Good evening, gentlemen.' Atlee croaked out. 'Considering how mistreated you men have been by the Utopains in the WUP, perhaps you would be willing to strike up a deal with my Pragmatists?'"
NH.britain.4.a:0 "'Perhaps, but for now let us have a drink.'"
NH.britain.5:0 "Starting a Commune Programme"
NH.britain.5.d:0 "Robert Owen in his time took a particular interest in communes. He led several communal expiriments, many of which were very successful. As well, Owen's expiriments with running the New Lanark mill were so successful they became a thing of international interest, with many visiting to study his methods.\nWe will attempt to replicate and build upon these expiriments, and start several communes in rural Britain, as well as creating communes in already developed areas that are interested."
NH.britain.5.a:0 "Well, it works in Japan."
NH.britain.6:0 "The Bio-Mechanical Man"
NH.britain.6.d:0 "Arnold Pernet began to open his eyes. The light of the hospital was near-blidning. Everything felt so different, as if his body was simply no longer the body he was born into.\n'What the hell happened to me?' he asked in a raspy voice.\n'You were in a vehicle accident.' the bedside nurse quietly responded. 'Your body was absolutely destroyed. We had to take several drastic actions to save your life.'\n'What do you mean by that?' The man shot back.\n'Your body was extensively biomechanically augmented.' said the nurse, afraid of the man's reaction. Arnold began to take deep breaths. As he did, he could feel the movement of mechanical parts within his chest, and could hear the sounds of electrical whirring. As he began to move his limbs, he began to realize they were no longer his. In place of where his arms and legs once were, he now saw metal replacements. When he moved whatsoever, he heard the clicking of his body parts. Arnold was not terrified, however. He was simply happy he was still alive, even if much of him wasn't living anymore."
NH.britain.6.a:0 "The future was yesterday. Now is something else."
NH.britain.7:0 "Dealing With The Party Opposition"
NH.britain.7.d:0 "While the Utopian faction is perhaps the most popular faction within the party, there are still many factions within the party that are very opposed to us. The two factions that pose the biggest problem are the Pragmatists and the Nationalists. The Pragmatists are our direct rival and the second largest faction, and are working hard to overtake us in leadership of the party. The Nationalists, while being very small and holding little sway within the party, have relatively large support base. They espouse regressive social rhetoric and extreme nationalism, and are quite frankly a stain on our organization. Rumors have it the nationalists are planning something big, and some have said they're willing to cooperate with the Pragmatists. Getting rid of the Pragmatists entirely is an impossibility, though we could certainly whittle them down some. The Nationalists however, are rather small and quite hated, and given how regressive and how much of a threat they are, we could gain a lot by getting rid of them.\n\nThere are two main courses of action being considered. Option one is simply forcibly voting the most problematic elements out. While this would get rid of the nationalists easily considering how hated they are, it is going to be very difficult to get any Pragmatists out, and if they catch wind we could have a big problem.\n\nOption two involves digging up dirt and exposing anybody we can, and getting people to vote them out naturally or make them resign themselves. While this could be more effective against the Pragmatists, we cannot guarentee that it is going to reliably get rid of anybody, and if people catch wind it could easily be turned back at us."
NH.britain.7.a:0 "Forcibly vote them out."
NH.britain.7.b:0 "Grab a shovel, we're digging up whatever dirt we can."
NH.britain.8:0 "Forcibly Voting Them Out"
NH.britain.8.d:0 "'Next motion up for consideration, the status of several members, including Phillip Snowden, Oswald Mosely...' the chair of the party continued to list several other names of either hard nationalists or the most rabblerousing Pragmatists.\n'We will vote induvidually on either the demotion or removal of these members. First on the list, the removal of Phillip Snowden.' The vote failed miserably, and many pragmatists within the party shouted and jeered at the idea of removing Snowden.\n'The motion fails. Next up, the removal of Oswald Mosely' This time, the vote passed overwhelmingly. As many in the party, Utopian and Pragmatist alike, shouted at Mosely to leave the room following the vote, Mosely began to scream.\n'YOU ARE ALL ANTI-BRITISH TERRORIST' Mosely screeched at the crowd. 'YOU BASTARDS WILL PAY FOR THIS! BRITAIN WILL MARCH ON WITHOUT THE LIKES OF YOU DEGENERATE FUCKS!'\n"
NH.britain.8.a:0 "'Security, please remove this reactionary nutjob.'"
NH.britain.9:0 "Grabbing a Shovel"
NH.britain.9.d:0 "For a good week, Oswald Mosely and several other WUP members had dissapeared from the public entirely, and had taken to staying in their homes where they could not be critisized.\nMosely, as it turns out, had cheated on his wife with not only both of her sisters, but even her mother. Mosely's wife seemingly wants to divorce the man immidiately, and the incident has entirely destroyed Oswald Moseley's reputation.\nEvery day the prior week, scandal after scandal after scandal had been revealed about many WUP officials as their secrets were dug up and smeared all across the country. Considering the volume of the scandals, many had begun to expect that this was a coordinated effort, and since it seemed that Utopians were largely exempt from the incident, many began to point figures. The Utopians of course, denied this in stride. It didn't really matter who did it anymore however, the damage had been done and the victims would never again have a high standing within the WUP"
NH.britain.9.a:0 "It seems we struck gold while digging!"
NH.britain.10:0 "A Day in New Tranquility"
NH.britain.10.d:0 "It was a nice, bright day in the commune of New Tranquility near Lanark. Jessica Green woke up at about 7 AM, along with the rest of the residents. Jessica was a woman in her early twenties, who had signed up to join the commune at the promise of a free college education, though she enjoyed her time in the commune so much she hardly thought about leaving it. She shot up, put her favorite shirt and slacks on, and rushed to the cafetertia so she could have her favorite flavor muffin before they ran out.\nThere was one blueberry muffin remaining. She ran to intercept it, though upon reaching for the muffin, she touched the hand of one Samantha Reid, who had also been reaching for the muffin. Both of the girls began to blush, and began trying to force out a sentance reguarding the muffin.\n'Oh- sorry, I- uh' Jessica stammered.\n'Blueberry is my favorite flavor' Samantha said, her face turning redder by the second. 'Mine as well, haha' giggled back Jessica.\n'Split it?'\n'Split it.'\n\n The two girls sat across from each other at a small table, and began to eat their muffin halves and talk. They found they had much in common, both hailing from London, both joining New Tranquility for a college education, and both WUP voters, along with much else. Both of them happened to work across the commune at one of the agroponics complexes. They hopped on their bikes and side by side rode to their work, laughing all of the way. They stayed together the entire day, joking, laughing, gossiping, and complimenting each other's appearance. Their jobs hardly felt like work in each other's company, and time nearly ceased to exist for the two. They biked back to the residential building at quitting time, and again ate together, this time sitting closely next to each other. When they finished their meals, Samantha agreed to walk Jessica back to her apartment.\n'Well, this is where I get off.' Jessical was looking at her shoes. Samantha drew slightly closer and Jessica looked up at her eyes. 'I guess this is goodb-' Samantha grabbed the other girl's face and the two shared a passionate kiss.\n'Or, perhaps we should take this inside?'"
NH.britain.10.a:0 "'Well! Perhaps we should!'"
NH.britain.11:0 "The 'New View'"
NH.britain.11.d:0 "Robert Owen's main philosophy was something he called the 'New View of Society'. The main principle of the New View is that human character is formed by conditions in which they have no control, therefore to a certain extent people cannot be praised or blamed for their behavior or situation in life. This leads to the conclusion that humans must be placed in good conditions to better the general character of human society. We will implement numerous reforms improve the conditions of children so they may have a better starting situation and better chance in their lives."
NH.britain.11.a:0 "How can someone be blamed for their situation if they had no control over their starting condition?"
NH.britain.12:0 "Attlee's Resignation"
NH.britain.12.d:0 "'Effective immidiately I, Clemenet Attlee, hereby resign from my position in the Workers Union Party.\nIt is clear now that my pragmatic ideals for achieving socialism would have failed, as the Utopian policy has been incredibly successful and popular. Prime Minster Wells has led Britain to a place in which I never could have.\nTherefore, it is clear that I am no longer needed by the socialist cause and should remove myself from the WUP.'"
NH.britain.12.a:0 "Good riddance!"
NH.britain.13:0 "Wells' Resignation"
NH.britain.13.d:0 "'Effective immidiately I, H.G Wells, hereby resign from my position in the Workers Union Party.\nIt is clear now that my utopian ideals for achieving socialism would have failed, as even the pragmatist has struggled to take hold. If the utopian ideals had been attempted, we would have failed miserably and been voted out in the next election. Prime Minster Attlee has led Britain to a place in which I never could have.\nTherefore, it is clear that I am no longer needed by the socialist cause and should remove myself from the WUP.'"
NH.britain.13.a:0 "Good riddance!"
NH.britain.14:0 "A Meeting With Moseley"
NH.britain.14.d:0 "Clement Attlee lightly knocked on the door, half hoping nobody would be in the office.\n'Come in!' responded Moseley from the other side. Attlee slowly opened the door. 'Ah! Clement! To what do I owe the pleasure?'\n'Well Oswald, I have an offer for you.' Attlee's speaking was sheepish. 'Would you like the job of Secretary of State for Defense?'\n'Really? This is quite the suprise! Why come to me for this job, exactly?' Moseley wanted to hear Attlee say the reason out loud, even if he already knew it.\n 'Oh- I uh- well you know-' stuttered Attlee. n\'Out with it man!' shouted Moseley, eager for his response.\n'Simply as a gesture of goodwill and friendship between us, along with the fact that I believe you have the skills for this.'"
NH.britain.14.a:0 "'Well, of course I accept!'"
NH.britain.15:0 "Hatching a Plot"
NH.britain.15.d:0 "We have to main options for dealing with Edward. We could either try to dig up dirt on him and cause a scandal, or simply kill him.\nA scandal would be rather easy to find, as Edward has always been a controversial figure. He is known to have several mistresses, so it's not a stretch that we could find something big enough to make him abdicate.\nThe other option is toi simply kill him, which would most definitely get rid of him. Plus, amny people believes he deserves it for all he's done.\nThis is a delicate affair, and the outcome of our plot shall decide the fate of Britain."
NH.britain.15.a:0 "The fuck has it coming."
NH.britain.16:0 "A Peculiar Trip"
NH.britain.16.d:0 "Quite conviniently, just after we decided to smear Edward, he made a sudden and unannounced trip to the United Commonwealth. We found this to be quite suspicious, so we decided to send a few agents to America to see what was going on.\n As it turns out, he was making the trip in order to have a secret meeting with Wallis Simpson, an American actress, who he was apparently having an affair with.\nThis is huge, and with this evidence we can reveal a scandal big enough to have him abdicate."
NH.britain.16.a:0 "Some things never change, do they?"
NH.britain.17:0 "The Plan"
NH.britain.17.d:0 "The plan is rather simple. During King Edward's sudden trip to the United Commonwealth we will have an agent place a bomb which will be remotely detonated. This will ensure that nobody is seen assasinating him, helping the plot not be traced back to us.\nWe are also going to have pro-NPP fliers remotely dropped from surrounding buildings, which will make the NPP the first suspect."
NH.britain.17.a:0 "Time to make history."
NH.britain.18:0 "Edward VIII Dies in Bombing!"
NH.britain.18.d:0 "King Edward tragically died today in a bombing while on his suprise trip to the United Commonwealth. Upon attempting to walk to his reserved vehicle that was to take him to a now-undisclosed location, a bomb placed underneath the ground exploded, killing the King instantly. Five minutes after the explosion, propaganda posters from the National Peoples' Party, an ultranationalist party within Britain, rained from the sky. Posters read things such as 'Britain Lives And Marches On!' and 'Death to The Socialist Menace!'. Due to these posters, the NPP is under thorough investigation. Even if it turns out they are not the culprits, the incident has completely destroyed their public reputation."
NH.britain.18.a:0 "King Edward is dead! Long live Albert I!"
NH.britain.19:0 "Edward VIII Abdicates Following Scandal!"
NH.britain.19.d:0 "Today, King Edward VIII suddenly abdicated following a scandal that revealed he had been having an affair with American actress Wallis Simpson.\n Reportedly, his recently unplanned trip to the United Commonwealth was a plan with Simpson to meet in secret. Edward's wife apparently wants to divorce immidiately, and Edward has withdrawn from public life. In light of this, Prince Albert has been coronated as George VI, choosing the title to symbolize a continuing of his father's reign, and to distance himself from the disgraced former monarch."
NH.britain.19.a:0 "Long live George VI!"
NH.britain.20:0 "Collapse of the NNP"
NH.britain.20.d:0 "Following the assasination of Edward VIII, the NPP was overwhelmingly blamed by the public, despite little evidence they were behind it besides the dropped posters.\nThis blame has basically destroyed the NPP, and as they lost public support they began to fight. This culminated in the NPP dissolving following an intense shouting match in their final meeting. The British right has been dealt a crippling blow."
NH.britain.20.a:0 "Good riddance!"
NH.britain.21:0 "Future of Socialism in Britain"
NH.britain.21.d:0 "Ever since the collapse of the Pragmatist wing, the Utopians have become increasingly divided regurading how to move forward. This has led to about five major camps coalescing within the WUP.\n The first is the Harmonists, who are the largest group. They consist of orthodox utopian socialists adhering closely to the ideas of Robert Owen. They wish to grow the communal system and make a cooperative economy the main economic system within the country. Reguarding technological development, they favor a balanced approach with attempting to look into as many new ideas as possible in order to find as many good things as we can.\n The second are the trade Unionists, who wish for workers' unions to be the main system of governance in power within the country. Being Unionists, they belive strongly in cooperative economics and the collective ownership. Technologically, they lean towards the expansion of industrial technology to make it more efficient and safer.\nThe third are known as the Councilists. They believe in organization by 'workers councils', sometimes nicknamed soviets from the Russian word for workers' council. These councils form a pyrimid like system, with workers councils at the bottom electing a representative to the council above, and then so on until the top supreme council which primarily runs the country. Most uniquely, they want there to be no central leadership, and belive that the 'supreme council' should run the country as a head of state would. They are also largely industrial leaning, however they also tend to pay more attention to farming.\nNext are the so called 'Vanguardists' who believe that considering socialism is basically a non-existant force in most of the world, that it needs to be protected by a stong vanguard to prevent it's collapse. They tend to lean on a more agrarian technological outlook, wanting to focus on technology that improves things such as farming to ensure we all stay fed.\nLast but most certainly not least are the representative socialists. They believe in evolving the representative democracy system we have now into a socialist one.\n\nThe main thread linking all of them however, is the ever growing notion that the monarchy has to go. Since Edward abdicated, the new monarch has basically done nothing, laying bare for all to see how ineffectual the monarchy truly is. The general consensus is that there will be a referendum on the status of the monarchy following the end of conflict with France."
NH.britain.21.a:0 "Reguardless, there is still much work to be done."
NH.britain.22:0 "The Plan for the Future"
NH.britain.22.d:0 "Since the Utopian faction of the party collapsed, the party has been stuck in discussion about what to do next. We have come to one main consensus; using the empire to spread socialism, and of course ensuring our future as a predominant party. Socialists exist all across Britain's empire, and while not all of us agree, we have enough in common that we may be able to shake out an agreement to work together. The concept is that uniting the socialists in Britain would not only solve the ever present issue of the disintegrating imperial federation, but it would also create a socialist bloc so large that it could cement socialism not only in the empire but turn it into a prominent thing worldwide. This won't be easy of course, but we believe that this is truly the best idea going forward."
NH.britain.22.a:0 "The Utopians never could have remained unified like this."
NH.britain.23:0 "The Trip"
NH.britain.23.d:0 "The London Central Aeroport was absolutely overflowing. Socialists from all walks of life, from everywhere in the world, gathered here today to take their chance at fighting for the cause.\nA young man who couldn't be older than twenty walked up to the recruitment bench within the airport, eager to enlist.\n'You want to enlist? I know you want to fight but come on now man! What if you die?' the recruiter said.\n'If I do not fight who will?'\n'The chances of you dying is very high.'\n'I understand, but please understand that if I do not risk my life, thousands and thousands of my countrymen will die certainly.'\n'You're French?'"
NH.britain.23.a:0 "'Yes I am, and my people will be liberated.'"
NH.britain.24:0 "Community"
NH.britain.24.d:0 "The new communal living style being adopted across the country has allowed for new living situations that nobody could have predicted before. One such situation is the so called 'Study Group' in one of the London communal areas. Originally the group was a study group for a community college, but as time went on they became closer and closer friends and eventually moved in together.\nThe group is composed of a Palestinian, a Jewish woman, someone named 'Britta', an old man, a black man and woman, and a white guy.\nThis group of people is an unprecedentedly diverse group of characters, and is a true sign of the progression of Britain."
NH.britain.24.a:0 "'Remember when we used to study Spanish?'"
NH.britain.25:0 "Attlee Gives A Speech!"
NH.britain.25.d:0 "'People of the Imperial Federation! I call upon each and every one of you today for one reason. We stand against a foe greater perhaps than any we have seen before. The Alliance of France and Russia craves not only control over Europe, but over the entire globe.\nFor a very long time, the empire has been gradually reforming and prividing freedom and liberty to all her subjects; but we have also drifted apart.\nToday I ask all of you, every single child of our federation, be you American, Quebecois, Victorian, British, Indian, Far Eastern, African, or what have you; I ask you all to stand together during this dark storm so that we together may weather this horrific threat. We not only face an enemy that hates our federation, but one that hates our freedom, our liberty, our very democracy! I ask, no- I BEG you to stand arm and arm and defend our liberty! Defend our freedom! Defend democracy! Defend the federation and our people!'"
NH.britain.25.a:0 "Perhaps, tonight the Empire will stand together to watch the sunrise."
NH.britain.26:0 "Discussing the Future of the WUP"
NH.britain.26.d:0 "Since the Utopian faction has become the main faction within the WUP, the Utopians have gradually began to splinter into several smaller cliques, all disagreeing on our future.\nThe party was initially created as a big tent party meant to include all socialists. Now that socialism is by far the biggest ideology in the country, it is no longer neccesary to have a big tent party. The party is ballooning as more and more Brits join, with the WUP being the only party for a leftist to join.\nThe proposition is to eventually split the party once it is no longer neccesary for all socialists to be organized under a tent. This would give the people different options for how they want socialism to be run, and create a multi-party socialist democracy.\nDespite all of the diverging viewpoints, more and more people are agreeing on one thing; that the monarchy is useless and should be done away with. Instead of attempting to reaffirm his rule, as opposition grows, he has simply begun to further draw away from the public, only proving how useless he is. Outside of the war with france which most of the empire is able to stay together on, the commonwealths are further pushing themselves away from Britain itself. With the empire increasingly splitting, and the people beginning to question the King's rule, perhaps it could be time to abolish the monarchy when the fight with the french is done with."
NH.britain.26.a:0 "Surely, a truly big change is on the horizon."
NH.britain.27:0 "Foundations for an All-Imperial Socialist Party"
NH.britain.27.d:0 "For awhile now, we have been meeting with different socialist leaders accross the Empire to discuss the creation of a unified socialist party. Though it's not been easy, we are finally on a direct track to the lofty goal. Since the completely botched mess the jacobins pulled within the United Commonwealth, many radicals had either left or renounced their past views, and the remaining are eager to compromise to salvage the mess that is American socialism. In Victoria, socialism is already a decently popular ideology, but with Victoria being so dependent on the empire, they have been quite willing to compromise. In Quebec, the socialists basically agreed immidiately, wanting to prove that they are not anti-imperial in light of the conflict with France. The largest hurdles have been overcome."
NH.britain.27.a:0 "Maybe we can actually get something done if we stand together."
NH.britain.29:0 "Referendum on the Monarchy"
NH.britain.29.d:0 "The outcome of the referendum was a shocking 76.2% abolish and 23.8% keep. A descicive anti-monarch victory. It seems that with the King having basically removed himself from public life, people realized that having a monarch was a pointless, antiquated thing.\nThe King did not put up a fight, he did not contest the referendum, nor defend himself in any way. He abdicated the throne in a quick speech, then silently left the isles for the United Commonwealth. It seems he never wanted to rule in the first place, and then his brother's scandal, and then increasing support for anti-monarchists took a toll on his mental health to the point he just didn't care anymore.\nThe rest of the Imperial Federation is now in a state of panic, with almost nobody in the rest of the Empire actually thinking the referendum would go through. The United Commonwealth has, as of now, taken leadership of the old Empire and is attempting to keep everything together. It is expected that more anti-monarchist places such as Acadia will also attempt to leave the empire, and that some sort of major reformation is going to happen in whatever then remains of the Imperial Federation.\nThough, that all hardly matters anymore, as we are no longer part of the Empire! We are free from the monarchy and now may pursue our socialist future without resistance by those reactionaries. Our new provisional government has moved to immidiately start trying to set up socialist republics in the parts of europe we occupy, and has also moved to set up ties with other socialist or jacobin nations.\nWith the monarchy gone, the WUP has no more reason to stay together and it is expected that the party will be dissolved shortly."
NH.britain.29.a:0 "We really did it!"
NH.britain.30:0 "Dissolution of the Worker's Union Party"
NH.britain.30.d:0 "Before the vote to dissolve the WUP. Chairman Wells gave a speech.\n'We have come farther than many of us thought possible. Just a few years ago when the WUP was first elected, socialism was just an up-and coming underdog to the giant monster that was capitalism. Back then, Britain was a fully capitalist nightmare under a monarch that showed active authoritarian sympathies. Today, we no longer live in that world. Socialism in Britain has not only grown to prominence, but has grown to be the sole force guiding our future. We have abolished the monarchy and transitioned into a truly free and democratic republic. With socialism now being the main ideology within Britain, the big-tent party of the WUP no longer has any real purpose and only serves to be a bloated mess that stands in the way of democracy by having the ability to basically choose Britain's leaders internally. Due to all of this, today we will vote to abolish the WUP and step into a new era of a multi-party socialist democracy. We are now in a time in which socialism and human rights are a guarantee, and we can now afford to choose even further the direction of our decidedly socialist future. The WUP served its purpose, but now it is time to say goodbye. I have also decided to resign effective immidiately from politics to ensure the future of our democracy and to ensure that power does not concentrate into my hands, and thus the hands of my successor. It was an honour to serve this country, but it is now time for me and the WUP to stand aside and allow somebody esle to take the reigns. Thank you, and good luck.'\nAfter the WUP party dissolved, five main new parties have taken its place as the options in the upcoming elections. The Harmonist party. who are orthodox utopians, the Federation of British Unions. who are trade unionists, the Councilist Worker's Party, who are the councilists, the People's Labour Party, who are vanguardists, and finally the Socialist-Republicans who subscribe to representative republicanism.\nThe elections is as of now, anybody's game. The future of socialist Britain is soon going to be decided."
NH.britain.30.a:0 "Yet another fork in the road."
NH.britain.31:0 "Formalization of the Socialist International"
NH.britain.31.d:0 "The WUP worked quietly for a long time to create what we call a 'Socialist International', which would be a worldwide, global alliance open to all socialist nations. Currently it consists of the Danubians, Japan, and Britain, with the Republic of California opting to become an observer. It is ecpected that our alliance will grow as we set up socialist governments in occupied europe, and as more nations fall to their own revolutions."
NH.britain.31.a:0 "Today we stand together!"
NH.britain.occupied.1:0 "Fall of Paris to British Troops"
NH.britain.occupied.1.d:0 "Paris has fallen to British troops, putting france effectively in our control. With descicive control of the city, we now have significant leverage to do what we'd like with the occupation going forward."
NH.britain.occupied.1.a:0 "The mighty have fallen."
NH.britain.occupied.3:0 "Fall of Rome to British Troops"
NH.britain.occupied.3.d:0 "Rome has fallen to British troops, putting Italy effectively in our control. With descicive control of the city, we now have significant leverage to do what we'd like with the occupation going forward."
NH.britain.occupied.3.a:0 "And so falls the old world."
NH.britain.occupied.2:0 "Fall of Madrid to British Troops"
NH.britain.occupied.2.d:0 "Madrid has fallen to British troops, putting Spain effectively in our control. With descicive control of the city, we now have significant leverage to do what we'd like with the occupation going forward."
NH.britain.occupied.2.a:0 "The Iberian Campain went far better this time around."
NH.britain.32:0 "Setting up Socialist Governments in Occupied Europe"
NH.britain.32.d:0 "In the areas we occupy on the continent, there is currently little official government. This makes these places ripe for the spread of socialism. Considering that many anti-neo-imperialist resistance groups ended uo veering to the left, there are already tons of local socialist leader that can be put in control of their respective countries. Many civillians who hated the neo-imperialists also ended up becoming increasingly radical seeing what capitalism's decay brings, therefor the new socialist governments will be at least moderately popular."
NH.britain.32.a:0 "The revolution spreads."
NH.britain.33:0 "The Trials"
NH.britain.33.d:0 "'...sentanced to life in prison.' the crowd booed and jeered at the monster that lay before them. Head of the largest concentration camp in France, this man was certainly not deserving of sympathy.\nDespite having caused so much suffering, the criminal began to weep in front of the crowd.\nThe crowd fell silent. They did not feel bad for him, they did not pity him, but his wails and cries reminded them of the pain and suffereing the war had brought.\nThe weeping monster was torn away from the room, and the onlooking crowd remained silent for the rest of the trials."
NH.britain.33.a:0 "After all he did he dares to cry?"
NH.britain.34:0 "A New Election!"
NH.britain.34.d:0 "Today, elections were held to decide the future of the new Socialist Britain.\nThe candidates consist of Eric Blair for the Harmonist/Representative party, Harry Politt for the Vanguardists, and lastly the Councilists/Trade Unionists advocate for having no head of state, and instead ruling by a supreme Worker's Council.\n"
NH.britain.36:0 "Founding of the All-Imperial Socialist Party"
NH.britain.36.d:0 "Today in London, leaders from the various socialist parties all across the empire held a joint press conference announcing the creation of a new 'All-Imperial Socialist Party'\nThe point of this party is so that ll of the socialists in the empire may work together to bring about the future.\nThe creation of this party has greatly alarmed conservative elements within the empire, who are terrified at this massive socialist force undermining them.\nAttempts have been made at hashing out some conservative party, but considering the conservatives acreoss the empire all seem to want various things, so far all talks have fallen through."
NH.britain.36.a:0 "We must bring about the future together."
NH.britain.37:0 "Leauge of Nations Human Rights Declaration"
NH.britain.37.d:0 "Today, the League formally ratified the 'Declaration of the Rights of the Human Race'.\nThis says that all human beings deserve to have their basic needs met, to be able to express and speak freely, to be able to have a say in their government's running, along with a myriad of other things.\nThis decleration is an example to all that the Leauge of Nations is fully committed to ensuring all human beings on this planet earyh have access to what they need to survive, and that they are able to live freely and happily."
NH.britain.37.a:0 "May we all work together to meet these cherished goals."
NH.britain.38:0 "Another Imperial Conference"
NH.britain.38.d:0 "Over the next few weeks, we are going to be holding another, very different, and very important Imperial conference.\nWe shall propose a truly united and federalized empire.\nWe have pulled the empire closer in the past years, showing to people that we work better when we are all together. As well, we have created the first united Imperial party already, and have convinced many moderate socialists that an Imperial Federation is our future. Of course, this will not be easy and many of the biggest Imperial constituents have gotten very comfortable with their distance from the crow.\nDespite this, we truly belive that this is going to usher in a new age for our people, so we are going to do everything we can to make the Imperial Federation a reality."
NH.britain.38.a:0 "It will be a miracle if the Americans even consider our proposal."
NH.britain.39:0 "Negotiation with the Commonwealth of Victoria"
NH.britain.39.d:0 "Rather unsuprisingly, the Victorians had little objection to our ideas. Socialism has been rather prominent in Victoria, since before we were even on the scene.\nAlong with this, the Victorians have always been one of the least unruly Commonwealths, and have stayed very tied to Britain since their commonwealth was declared.\nSeeing the other colonies on the island as threats, many Victorians are very eager to get even futher protection, as well."
NH.britain.39.a:0 "Who really thought the model commonwealth would not stand by us?"
NH.britain.40:0 "A meeting with the Quebecois"
NH.britain.40.d:0 "The Quebecois were extremely apprehensive on our ideas.\nBeing a majority french speaking commonwealth, the Quebecois were of course, scared by the idea of being absorbed by the English speaking world. We however, were entirely prepared to make concessions to the Quebecois.\nSince the end of the Second World War, there has been something of an influence battle ongoing in continental France. The French are rather apprehensive on siding fully with either us or Germany due to the rabid francophobia in both nations since the beginning of the war. However, we could prove that we are friendly to the french world by admitting Quebec into the Imperial Federation, and making sure they retain language rights. Seeing us treat their former colony so well would certainly thaw our relations with France.\nUpon our promise of not only ensuring French langauge rights, but making French the second official language of the federation, the Quebecois delegates were awestruck. They seemingly had no anticipation we would be so friendly to them, and afterwards the Quebecois were very open to our suggestions."
NH.britain.40.a:0 "They are in the Empire like all of us, no matter their language."
NH.britain.41:0 "The Toughest Nut to Crack"
NH.britain.41.d:0 "Our delegation to the conference was incredibly nervous that the Americans would outright refuse all of our propositions.\nThis was for good reason too, as America has a reputation for having a mind of its own within the empire, and many see the United Commonwealth as being on the same level as Britain proper.\nAs expected, the American delegation was extremely stubborn to even listen to us, despite both the Victorian and Quebecois delegations supporting us. America was vehement that they maintain sovereignty.\nApparently the Americans in the All-Imperial socialist party were anticipating this as well, because somehow unbeknownst to our delegation, they had organized a massive gathering of people picketing outside the building for America to join the Imperial Federation.\nEven so, we had to make even more concessions than we initially anticipated would be neccesary.\n The concessions decided upon were as follows:\n1. The capitol of the federation should not only rotate around the Empire, but should NEVER again be situated in London.\n2. t should not only be an agreed upon expectation, but signed into iron law that no associate within the federation should have more power over another, and that an entire department dedicated to ensuring balance within the empire should be founded.\n 3. The new Imperial Federation shall have an entirely new constitution written, and the new constitution should take more influence from that of the United Commonwealth than Britain.\nOf course these agreements are extremely harsh, but it was indeed expected that America would be hard to get. Having America fully commit to the empire is more than worth even harsher agreements than these."
NH.britain.41.a:0 "My god, is it really happening?"
NH.britain.42:0 "The New York Declaration"
NH.britain.42.d:0 "Today in New York, specifically NOT London, the King, Prime Minister Atlee, and the Prime Ministers of Quebec, Victoria, and the United Commonwealth issued a joint declaration creating a new 'United Imperial Federation'.\nBritain herself, Quebec, America, and Victoria shall be united under one common government, with a brand new constitution.\nAfter so much work, so much hardship, we are truly united.\nElections are to be held shortly to form the new government of the United Imperial Federation, and it is expected to be a landslide for the All-Imperial Socialist Party.\nFinally, all in the empire can truly walk arm in arm to the future."
NH.britain.42.a:0 "The sun shall NEVER set on the Imperial Federation!"
NH.britain.46:0 "Harmonist Victory!"
NH.britain.46.d:0 "The Harmonist party, under loved war hero Eric Blair, has won the election.\nEric Blair held a speech after his victory, to national jubilation.\n'My friends, my comrades, my compatriots!\nI imagine a world in the future, a world where all are free, all are equal. The grip of capitalism has slipped away, leaving a socialist world.\nPeople work not for bosses, but for themselves. People work for their own pleasure.\nI imagine a future in which evryone lives in a community, a community in which they will never be alone and they will always have support.\nI imagine a world simply, where we are finally happy.\nI call this world my ideal 1984, and we are on the path to achieving it."
NH.britain.46.a:0 "Onwards! To 1984!"
NH.britain.47:0 "Councilist/Trade Unionist Victory"
NH.britain.47.d:0 "The councilists and trade unionists have won the election.\nHaving no candidate, they obviously were unable to give an actual speech, however a public meeting was called in which the biggest counciist and trade union leaders all gave mini-speeches.\nThey expressed hope for the future, expressed hope for the continuing of democracy, and some expresssed plans for the future."
NH.britain.47.a:0 "All power to the unions and councils!"
NH.britain.48:0 "Vanguardist Victory"
NH.britain.48.d:0 "Upon news of his victory, Harry Politt held a massive public rally in which he gave a speech to the cheering masses.\n'Comrades! Today we stand here on the precipice of the future! Today we stand on the edge of freedom and happiness!\nHowever, the road is not clear.\nIn front of us stands nearly the entire globe, all of the old staus quo, who all wish for us to crash and burn.\nBut we will not crash and burn! Today we will stand together and form an iron sheild to protect our revolution! We will stand arm and arm and crush all those who stand in the way of our future!"
NH.britain.48.a:0 "Long live the Vanguard! Long live Comrade Politt!"
NH.britain.50:0 "The London Delaration"
NH.britain.50.d:0 "Today in London, the leaders of Britain and her socialist allies in western Europe have declared that our nations are uniting into one socialist union.\nThis is a glorious day for the world revolution.\nWhile the British government has taken leadership for now, all nations are to be equal in the union and all will have the same rights."
NH.britain.50.a:0 "We... we really did it!"


NH.britain.fp.1:0 "The Mess That is East Africa"
NH.britain.fp.1.d:0 "East Africa is quite possibly the most dysfunctional and bad to live in colony within the British Empire.\nRun by Sir John Pershing, the colony consists nearly entirely of a direct milliary occupation, with ay sort of home rule being near non-existant, besides the large American population that get special treatment from the governor-general.\nPershing himself is a despot, who is running the colony as his personal 'Little America'. He is attempting to force Americanization on East Africa, by offering tons of incentives to Americans to move there, and then by giving them special treatment. The native population of course hates this, and the colony faces tons of native resistance. Pershing is also a rabid Americanist, and it is clear his loyalties lie firmly in Philidelphia."
NH.britain.fp.1.a:0 "What a damn mess."
NH.britain.fp.2:0 "The Future of the Empire"
NH.britain.fp.2.d:0 "The British Empire, quite frankly, is a hot mess.\nThe Empire is made up of archaic, near ancient laws, mandates, treaties, agreements, etc. It is a complex web build to subjugate and extract from Britain/s gloabal territories, and this needs changing. We need to drag this empire into the 20th century, and make it an entity that serves ALL of it's subjects; not just the British ones."
NH.britain.fp.2.a:0 "Onwards!"
NH.britain.fp.3:0 "Meeting with the 'Big Six'"
NH.britain.fp.3.d:0 "The Big Six are six of the most influential, popular, and determined African leaders in the Authority. These men have much sway over the West African populace and society, therefor if we wish to make real and measurable change we need to meet with these leaders and negotiate with them.\nOf course, in order to not anger any Imperial leaders, we will have to ensure that we ouse a velvet glove for this, and not agree to anything that is going to make the conservatives go so up in arms. Along with that, these men aren't exactly friendly with us for obvious reasons, so we will have to be very careful when we negotiate."
NH.britain.fp.3.a:0 "Walking the tightrope."
NH.britain.fp.4:0 "Results of the Negotiations"
NH.britain.fp.4.d:0 "All in all, the negotiations went rather well. The agreement has been to form a new west African commonwealth, but keep it under the eyes of Imperial authorities in London. Any major descisions or democratic results wil have to be approved by London, though many local or small scale changes can be made without supervision. We wish we could have made the new West African Commonwealth an equal member, but conservative resistance has beem fierce. Many African leaders are understandably upset with this, but sadly there is really nothing more we can do.\nGod willing, we will one day be able to remove these restrictions and allow West Africa to decide her fate entirely on her own."
NH.britain.fp.4.a:0 "Pragmatism may not promise us the nicest results, but at least we get those results."
NH.britain.fp.5:0 "Meeting with the Socialists of the Empire"
NH.britain.fp.5.d:0 "Today, socialists from every stretch of the empire met in New York to discuss Socialism in the Imperial Confederation.\nClement Attlee gave a rousing speech, calling for the socialists across the empire to stand together so we may bring socialism to all Imperial subjects.\nThe speech was well recieved, and now many different socialist groups are working hand in hand to further the cause. As cooperation becomes closer, many are beginning to call for the formation of an All-Imperial Socialist Party, to ensure we can all work together as close as possible to make all of the Empire socialist."
NH.britain.fp.5.a:0 "Onwards! To the Future!"
NH.britain.fp.6:0 "Looking Inwards"
NH.britain.fp.6.d:0 "Instead of looking outwards and trying to focus on people outside of the Empire, we must focus on those within it who need help.\nOur empire is deeply, deeply flawed and is causing many to suffer greatly. We desperately need to help the people within the Empire be free so we may be stronger and happier. Perhaps then we can look outside."
NH.britain.fp.6.a:0 "Let us hope we do well."
NH.britain.fp.7:0 "Helping the Quebecois"
NH.britain.fp.7.d:0 "Quebec has never recieved well treatment by the empire.\nBeing majority francophone, the Quebecois have been shunned by the empire since the Great War. This has caused the Quebecois government to be slightly unstable, leading to many socialists beginning to gain popularity.\nThere is one issue with this however. These socialists are not fond of the Empire.\nIt is the Empire that has shunened Quebec and caused these issues. We must fix this.\nWe shall empower Quebec and directly talk to Quebecois socialists to try to bring them over."
NH.britain.fp.7.a:0 "They are still Imperial Subjects, no matter the language they speak."
NH.britain.fp.8:0 "Looking Outwards"
NH.britain.fp.8.d:0 "Across the world, socialists cry for reform and revolution, yet almost the entire world is against them.\nWe are alone the only global great power truly dedicated to revolutionary ideals. There is nobody else to support them. It must be us.\nWe will send support all over, to every corner of the world, to any socialist that needs it to bring about better lives for themselves."
NH.britain.fp.8.a:0 "Everyone in the world, together!"
NH.britain.fp.9:0 "Eric Blair Departs"
NH.britain.fp.9.d:0 "Today, Eric Blair, a noted writer just like Prime Minister Wells has left the country to go to Hungary and fight for the country in the Balkan War.\nHe and many other men and women have left the country for Hungary, dedicated to protecting the only revolution in continental Europe.\nBlair in particular is being watched, as he is a very popular and notible writer whom many look up to."
NH.britain.fp.9.a:0 "Good luck, Comrade Blair!"
NH.britain.fp.10:0 "Blair's Injury"
NH.britain.fp.10.d:0 "Heartbreaking news has come out of Hungary today.\nComrade Blair has been injured in an explosing during active combat. He is alright, yet will take much time to recover. Despite this, he refuses to give up the fight. Blair has declared that the second his body is ready he will grab his rifle once more and continue the fight.\nThis immense heroism has earned Blair the status of a national icon. Wells himself has praised Blair for his actions.\nAs well, the war seems to have galvanized Blair's political beliefs. He is more devout to the socialist idea than ever before."
NH.britain.fp.10.a:0 "We wish comrade Blair a speedy recovery!"

Albert I is a rather hands-off monarch, as he never exactly wanted to assume the throne.\nAlbert, since the death of his brother, has become a staunch critic of the far right within Britain, with one of his main goals as monarch being to de-fang Britain's right wing.\nAlbert is known to be a rather soft person, often wearing his feelings on his sleeve.\nAlbert's left arm was lost in an aeroplane accident while he served in the Great War, and he was given a mechanical replacement. His body has never taken kindly to the replacement arm, and he undergoes regular therapy to keep himself moderately healthy."
